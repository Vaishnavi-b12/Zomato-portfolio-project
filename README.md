# Zomato-portfolio-project
I have done my project on Zomato  where I found the sales, revenue and business model of it.

Zomato - Business Model and Revenue Model
The main source of revenue for Zomato now is the advertisements channel that the portal offers 
to display. This accounts for most of its revenue followed by the commissions that it charges 
to the restaurants. It works on a commission business model.

How Does Zomato Work?
The main work of Zomato is to suggest local and nearby restaurants to users and receive orders 
from them. Users can place orders from their favorite restaurant based on ratings and reviews 
shared by previous customers.Perhaps this is why more and more startup owners are interested 
in developing an app similar to Zomato. It offers comfort to the users and helps business owners 
reach their local food business to new heights.Zomato’s working flow is simple,
Step 1: From the desiccated app solution or website, users can explore various restaurants and 
order meals.
Step 2: Particular restaurant owners receive an order request and start preparing a meal.
Step 3: Once the food is ready to dispatch, it will be handed over to delivery providers.
Step 4: Delivery providers deliver the meal to the customer’s preferred location.
Step 5: From the given payment options, customers can make payments and share reviews 
based on their experience.


OBJECTIVES OF ANALYSIS
Zomato started as a Foodiebay.com startup, a service provider app which was supposed to be 
a restaurant directory which started in Delhi. Slowly Zomato expanded to other countries as 
well as cities in India. Launching a food delivery app in a country where people were not very 
used to takeouts, back then the culture of eating out was not popular in India. But an app which 
gave the service of ordering food and delivering it to our door step became popular and became 
a success. 
The main objective behind this analysis is finding out how Zomato managed to survive in 
the Indian market and how founders made it a huge success? What were their strategies? 
How the company handled the pandemic covid-19? And comparing Zomato with one of 
the top food delivery company Swiggy.


Zomato’s business model in detail
• Restaurant Listings / Advertising
In its first avatar, Zomato was just a listing platform and a restaurant directory. This 
brought in advertising revenues from restaurants who joined the platform. Extending 
this further after the launch of food delivery and restaurant reservations, Zomato now 
charges commissions from restaurants to be placed prominently on the feed. 
Restaurants can pay to have their events or offers promoted as well as their overall 
banner, which brings improved visibility and conversions from Zomato users.
• Food Delivery
To begin with, through its food delivery business, Zomato charges a commission to the 
restaurants on the basis of orders. While users pay a delivery fee, Zomato earns through 
restaurants who pay a commission for each delivery, which is then split among the 
delivery partner and the company. Commissions from restaurants vary based on 
whether Zomato is fulfilling the delivery or whether the restaurant uses its own riders. 
This is said to contribute in a small way to the company’s total income due to huge 
competition and need for deep discounts etc.
• Subscription Programmes
With Zomato Gold for consumers and users, and subscription solutions for restaurants, 
Zomato opened up a steady stream of revenue. While users pay a subscription fee to 
access the Zomato Gold loyalty programme which brings exclusive offers, restaurants 
also pay a monthly fee to be part of Zomato’s bouquet of offers. Restaurants also pay 
Zomato a monthly fee for miscellaneous services such as live tracking, Zomato-branded 
tamper-proof packaging and more.
• Live Events
With Zomaland, Zomato entered the branded live events market last year. Zomato 
charges users an entry fee to attend Zomaland, where besides food, they can witness 
live musical performances and other acts. In 2018, it had organised the entertainment 
carnival in Delhi, Pune, and Bengaluru, where Zomato claimed over 100K people 
showed up. This year, Zomaland is going to Pune, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, 
Mumbai, Jaipur, Pune, Chandigarh, and Kolkata.
• White Label Access
Zomato also enables services such as Zomato White label under which they give offers 
to the restaurants to develop a customized food delivery app. It also works with cloud 
kitchens and restaurants for consultancy services. Zomato works with select restaurant 
operators to help in identifying locations for expansions at a minimal fixed cost, but 
with increased options for the user. It provides the requisite licenses and operational 
enablement for such restaurant partners.
• Zomato Kitchens
In order to be able to provide kitchen infrastructure services to select restaurant 
operators, Zomato works with entrepreneurs to set up and operate Zomato Kitchens 
under different labels. This helps entrepreneurs fund restaurants in the right location 
with an investment of INR 35 Lakh and more. Zomato claims it offers returns in the 
range of INR 2 Lakh to INR 4 Lakh per month to the investors, with 180+ affiliate 
kitchens already up and running.
As it has grown in size and scale, Zomato has tried to reduce the reliance on cash-burn reliant 
models and streamlined to enter enablement and other user-generated streams of 
revenue. Zomato’s cash burn is mostly in retaining users against its rival Swiggy. However, 
being in the line of fire for deep discounting practices, Zomato may soon be able to earn from 
other parts of its business model.

CONCLUSION
If we go by numbers, Zomato witnessed a record rise of 225% in its revenue in the very first 
half of FY2020. The company’s biannual report revealed that it had registered $205 Mn in 
revenue as compared to $63 Mn (in the first half) of last year.
Zomato’s journey thus far has witnessed crests and troughs of its own. But it wouldn’t be 
wrong to say that ups and downs are faced by almost all startup companies in their initial 
years. What really matters, in the end, is their resilience, their will to stand by the organization 
and its values and the decisions they make in difficult situations. 
As for the founders, Deepindar and Pankaj, they’ve done a phenomenal job of keeping Zomato 
afloat even in times of crisis. Where in early 2018, Pankaj announced that he’d like to quit 
Zomato and take some time off before he turned “professionally active” again, he continues 
to hold a stake of 3.11% in the organization. 
Today, the company is looking forward to raising more funds with a vision to expand its 
service portfolio. It aims to reach newer markets and explore other related domains of growth. 
As Zomato battles it out with Swiggy - its biggest competitor, it will be interesting to see what 
lies ahead for this organization especially in a time when bigger players are entering the 
market.
